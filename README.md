## Notes
Steam Monster Game 2015 was a massively multiplayer game that ran during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale, with almost 5 million people playing. I was on one of the winning teams and this website was used to track our progress in real time. The event was super hectic, so I didn't have time to refactor the code much. It's quick and dirty. 

## How to use
1. Install python, pip
2. `$ pip install bleach`
3. Edit games.txt to the games you want to track
4. `$ python update.py`
